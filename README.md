# MtrD_Protonation

Supplementary data files for the paper "Coordination of substrate binding and protonation in the N. gonorrhoeae MtrD efflux pump conrols functionally rotating transport mechansim"

Files are separated based on the 1 Coarse-Grain and 5 United-Atom simulation systems listed in the paper. For each system- the molecule topologies, start and final .gro files for each simulation replicate, and the system .top file are included.
